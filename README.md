# rack-paper-scissors-game


The provided code implements a basic version of the rock-paper-scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file contains a title, a header displaying "Rock Paper Scissors," and three buttons labeled "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors" to represent the player's choices.

2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS code provides some basic styling to the webpage, including font selection and alignment.

3. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - When a player clicks one of the buttons, it triggers the `play()` function in JavaScript.
   - Inside the `play()` function, a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) is generated for the computer.
   - The player's choice and the computer's choice are then compared to determine the result of the game.
   - Depending on the outcome (win, lose, or tie), a message displaying the result along with the computer's choice is updated on the webpage.

4. **Result Display**: The result of each round (win, lose, or tie) is displayed below the buttons, informing the player about the outcome of their choice and the computer's choice.

5. **Gameplay**: The game allows the player to repeatedly click on the buttons to make choices and see the results of each round.

Overall, this code provides a simple and interactive implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game that can be played directly in a web browser.
